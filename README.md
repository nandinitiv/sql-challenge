# sql-challenge

## Project Overview

In this challenge, I engineered data on employees of a fictional company during the 1980s and 1990s. I imported CSV files into a SQL database and created an Entity Relationship Diagram of the data tables. After creating table schema for each CSV file, I performed queries to find information on employees, hire dates, managers, departments, as well as frequency of names of employees.

## The results have been organized as follows:
Sql-challenge/Query Results Screenshots
This folder contains image files of each query result.

Sql-challenge/Starter_Code Mod 9 Challenge/Starter_Code/data
This folder contains the original CSV files used to create the table schema.

Sql-challenge/Table Schemata Screenshots
This folder contains screenshots of each table.

The repository also contains SQL files of the table schematas and queries, in addition to a PNG file of the Entity Relationship Diagram.
